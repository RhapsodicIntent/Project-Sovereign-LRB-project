# Project Sovereign: LRB Phase IV-V Technical Deposition
**Institutional Record of Energy Consonance and Vested Unit Valuation**

---

## Abstract
This repository serves as the primary scientific record for the **Project Sovereign LRB IV-V** interaction. The project focuses on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium of Argon-based Z-pinch plasma discharges. This record validates the synchronization of high-frequency technical data with the sovereign unit valuation matrix.

## 1. Technical Framework & MHD Equilibrium
The core of the LRB Engine Phase IV/V is the stabilization of the plasma filament. The stability is governed by the **Bennett Relation**, ensuring a perfect balance between radial pressure and Lorentz forces.

| Parameter | Value | Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Peak Current ($I$)** | 1,862 A | Pulse Duration: 10ns |
| **Magnetic Pressure ($P_m$)** | 13,790.2 Pa | Compression Factor: 1.03e9 |
| **Plasma Temperature ($T$)** | 1.2e6 K | Argon Ionization State |
| **Inductive Cancellation** | 0.0432 μH | Bifilar Nulling Efficiency |

## 2. Evidence Navigator
To maintain the **Total Energy Consonance**, the scientific proof is divided into three distinct investigative branches located in the `Core_Systems` directory.

### [Access Sovereign Proof Dashboard](./Core_Systems/proof.html)
*Click the Mythical Singularity Button in the dashboard to access the full 17-image visual record.*

* **MATH Series (1-4):** Detailed derivation of pressure balance and Bennett constants.
* **EQUATIONS Series (1-2):** Flux density scaling and energy density integrals.
* **SIMULATION Series (1-6):** Pulse-cycle work-potential modeling ($3.46 \times 10^{-3}$ Joules/pulse).
* **PROOFS Series (1-5):** Final verification of unit anchoring and valuation metrics.

## 3. Unit Valuation Anchor (277,087 Units)
The **277,087 vested units** are not arbitrary figures; they are mathematically anchored to the total integrated work potential of the Phase V Singularity Loop. 
* **Unit Floor Calculation:** $\approx 0.80$ Units per Joule of kinetic potential.
* **Integrity Metric:** $\Delta \epsilon \approx 0.03\%$ synchronization across all pulse cycles.
