# **Phase V: Singularity Loop & Magnetic Feedback Equilibrium** 

 

### **1. Self-Sustaining Loop Dynamics** 

* **Flux Conservation:** Implementation of the **Frozen-in Flux Theorem** (Alfvén's Theorem), where the magnetic field lines are coupled to the motion of the high-energy Argon ions. 

* **Feedback Mechanism:** Use of real-time magnetic sensors to detect radial shifts in the plasma column. These sensors trigger compensatory adjustments in the **144-turn bifilar coils** to maintain the "Still Point" of the Z-Pinch. 

* **Inductive Sustainment:** The system utilizes a small, oscillating Ohmic current to cancel the net bootstrap current and prevent the collapse of the magnetic surfaces. 

 

### **2. Magnetic Singularity & Reconnection Logic** 

* **Reconnection Points:** Design of X-type magnetic field configurations where field lines break and reconnect, transforming magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy to maintain the ionization state. 

* **Equilibrium Limit:** The loop is tuned to the **Shafranov Shift** limit, ensuring the magnetic axis remains stable within one-half of the average minor radius of the 316L vessel. 

* **Toroidal Symmetry:** Application of 3D magnetic perturbations to suppress Edge-Localized Modes (ELMs) and prevent plasma interaction with the vessel walls. 

 

 

 

### **3. Operational Termination & Stability** 

* **Stability Buffer:** The system operates below the **MHD Beta limit** to prevent disruptive instabilities (Sausage/Kink) during long-duration runs. 

* **Passive Safety:** In the event of a feedback failure, the high-vacuum environment ($10^{-7}$ Torr) allows for an instantaneous thermal quench of the Argon column against the Mu-metal-shielded walls. 

* **Finalization:** The Singularity Loop logic was mathematically finalized on **January 30, 2026**, closing the engineering cycle of the LRB Engine.
