# **LRB Engine: Governing Physical Laws**

### **1. Magnetic Pressure (Containment Force)**

The radial pressure exerted by the bifilar coils to compress the Argon plasma is defined by the energy density of the magnetic field:
$$P_B = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}$$

### **2. Lorentz Force (Ion Acceleration)**

The kinetic force acting on individual Argon ions within the Z-Pinch filament:
$$\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})$$

### **3. The Bennett Relation (Equilibrium Condition)**

For the Phase V Singularity Loop to maintain steady-state equilibrium, the current ($I$) must balance the internal kinetic pressure:
$$I^2 = 8\pi N k T$$
