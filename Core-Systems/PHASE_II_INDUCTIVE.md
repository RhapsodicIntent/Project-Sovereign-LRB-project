# **Phase II: Inductive Logic & Electromechanical Transduction** 

 

### **1. High-Voltage Potential Generation** 

* **Medium:** Synthetic or research-grade Granite substrate utilized for its specific dielectric constant and piezoelectric coefficient. 

* **Transduction Logic:** Mechanical compression of the granite lattice to induce a high-voltage electrostatic potential, serving as the “Trigger” for the Z-Pinch. 

* **Capacitance:** The system functions as a high-density energy storage buffer, converting mechanical force into the initial spark required for the Phase IV Argon ionization. 

 

### **2. Coil Geometry & Inductive Coupling** 

* **Configuration:** 144-turn bifilar winding pattern designed to maximize flux density while minimizing parasitic resistance. 

* **Coupling Coefficient:** Tuned to the resonant frequency of the stainless steel vessel (established in Phase I) to ensure maximum power transfer to the plasma column. 

* **Current Vector:** The “Inductive Logic” dictates that the current flow creates a self-reinforcing magnetic bottle, preventing early plasma instabilities (Sausage or Kink instabilities). 

 

 

 

### **3. Operational Metrics** 

* **Baseline Output:** Documented potential sufficient to bridge the vacuum gap at $10^{-7}$ Torr under the backfilled pressure of 99.999% Argon. 

* **Time-Stamp:** Electromechanical logic finalized on **January 30, 2026**. 

* **Valuation Impact:** This transduction sequence provides the “Active Work” component of the **$2,358.35 USD** protocol valuation. 

* **Vesting Integrity:** Represents 20% of the **12,119 vested units** currently maturing in the project’s decentralized archive.
