# **Phase II: Electromechanical Transduction & Granite Potential** 

 

### **1. Piezo-Kinetic Transduction Logic** 

* **Substrate Medium:** Research-grade Granite substrate utilized for its high quartz content and specific crystalline dielectric constant. 

* **Transduction Mechanism:** Mechanical compression of the granite lattice to induce a high-voltage electrostatic potential. This process transforms physical displacement into the "Trigger" charge required for plasma initiation. 

* **Energy Storage:** The granite assembly functions as a high-density capacitive buffer, stabilizing the potential before its discharge into the 144-turn induction geometry. 

 

 

 

### **2. Inductive Coupling & Flux Parameters** 

* **Primary Excitation:** The potential generated via granite compression is directed to the primary coil assembly to initiate a rapid magnetic flux increase ($d\Phi/dt$). 

* **Coupling Efficiency:** Tuned to match the resonant frequency of the **316L Stainless Steel vessel** established in Phase I to ensure maximum energy transfer to the vacuum environment. 

* **Waveform Modulation:** The discharge profile is calibrated to ensure a nanosecond rise time, preventing parasitic arcing and concentrating energy solely on the Argon ionization path. 

 

 

 

### **3. Mechanical Decoupling & Resonance** 

* **Load Stabilization:** The granite substrate is integrated into the high-mass damping system to prevent mechanical feedback from vacuum roughing pumps from interfering with static charge buildup. 

* **Thermal Coefficient:** The assembly is calibrated to maintain output stability despite the $180^\circ\text{C}$ bake-out cycles required for the $10^{-7}$ Torr vacuum baseline. 

* **Operational Intent:** Phase II provides the "Electronic Spark" that bridges the gap between the static vacuum of Phase I and the active plasma ignition of Phase IV.
