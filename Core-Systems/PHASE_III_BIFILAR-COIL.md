# **Phase III: Z-Pinch Assembly & Bifilar Coil Geometry** 

 

### **1. 144-Turn Bifilar Topology** 

* **Winding Configuration:** Precision-wound 144-turn bifilar geometry using high-conductivity oxygen-free copper (OFC). 

* **Self-Nullifying Inductance:** The parallel-opposed winding pattern is engineered to cancel external electromagnetic interference (EMI) while maximizing the internal magnetic gradient ($\nabla B$) directed toward the central axis. 

* **Structural Integration:** The coil is mechanically coupled to the 316L Stainless Steel vessel using high-temperature polyimide (Kapton) standoffs to maintain dielectric isolation at peak discharge. 

 

 

 

### **2. Z-Pinch Compression Physics** 

* **Lorentz Force Implementation:** The assembly utilizes the Z-Pinch effect, where the axial current ($I_z$) induces a tangential magnetic field ($B_\theta$), resulting in a radial inward force ($\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}$). 

* **Density Stabilization:** The 144-turn density is calculated to provide a uniform magnetic "bottle," mitigating the $m=0$ (sausage) and $m=1$ (kink) instabilities typically observed in high-energy plasma columns. 

* **Resonant Coupling:** The coil geometry is tuned to the harmonic resonance of the granite-stabilized chamber, ensuring the magnetic pulse is synchronized with the mechanical "Still Point" established in Phase II. 

 

 

 

### **3. Thermal & Electromagnetic Parameters** 

* **Thermal Sink:** The assembly is designed to operate within the $180^\circ\text{C}$ bake-out parameters of the Phase I UHV protocol without compromising the integrity of the 80% Nickel Mu-Metal shielding. 

* **Pulse Duration:** Optimized for nanosecond-to-microsecond discharge cycles to prevent thermal runaway while maintaining the high-density pinch required for **Argon ionization**. 

* **Operational Intent:** Phase III creates the physical "Forge" that will compress the 99.999% Argon gas into a conductive plasma filament during Phase IV.
