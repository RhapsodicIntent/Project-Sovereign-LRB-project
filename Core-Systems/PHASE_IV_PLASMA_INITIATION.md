# **Phase IV: Plasma Initiation & Harmonic Resonance** 

 

### **1. Gas Medium Parameters** 

* **Gas Selection:** 99.999% Pure Argon (Research Grade). 

* **Inertial Density:** $1.784\text{ kg/m}^3$ at STP. 

* **Function:** Argon serves as the working fluid for the Z-Pinch, providing a predictable ion-to-electron ratio for high-stability plasma formation. 

 

### **2. Ionization Sequence** 

The transition from gas to plasma occurs in three distinct nanosecond intervals: 

1.  **Pre-Ionization:** A high-frequency “pilot” discharge prepares the Argon path. 

2.  **The Pinch (Z-Effect):** As the 144-turn induction coils discharge, the Lorentz force ($\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})$) collapses the gas toward the central axis. 

3.  **Luminous Equilibrium:** The gas reaches a state of radiant emission, forming a conductive filament capable of carrying the secondary Inductive Logic load. 

 

### **3. Resonance & “The Still Point”** 

* **Harmonic Constant:** The system is tuned to the resonant frequency of the stainless steel vessel. 

* **Causative Implementation:** Utilizing Informational Causative Theory, the initiation is timed to the “rhythmic balanced interchange” of the vacuum pressure.
