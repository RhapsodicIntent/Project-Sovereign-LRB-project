 

# **Phase V: Singularity Loop & Magnetic Feedback Equilibrium** 

 

### **1. Flux Conservation & Alfvénic Dynamics** 

* **Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Stability:** Implementation of the **Frozen-in Flux Theorem**, where the magnetic field topology is coupled to the velocity field of the ionized Argon medium. 

* **Magnetic Reynold’s Number ($R_m$):** The system is tuned to a high $R_m$ regime, ensuring that magnetic induction dominates over diffusion, thereby maintaining the integrity of the pinch column. 

* **Loop Closure:** The 144-turn bifilar geometry acts as a secondary transformer winding, capturing the back-EMF from the plasma to reinforce the primary containment field. 

 

 

 

### **2. Feedback Stabilization & “The Still Point”** 

* **Non-Linear Control Logic:** Real-time monitoring of the azimuthal magnetic field ($B_\theta$) allows for nanosecond adjustments to the coil current, suppressing $m=0$ (sausage) instabilities before they reach the critical growth rate. 

* **Resonant Feedback:** The loop frequency is slaved to the granite-stabilized harmonic of the 316L vessel, utilizing the mechanical mass of the system as a “ballast” for electromagnetic oscillations. 

* **Shafranov Equilibrium:** The plasma column is centered using a vertical field adjustment to compensate for the outward expansion force, ensuring the singularity remains at the geometric center of the Mu-metal-shielded vacuum. 

 

 

 

### **3. Sustained Ionization & Thermal Quench Safety** 

* **Ohmic Heating:** Continuous current drive within the loop maintains the Argon medium above its recombination temperature, preserving the conductive state without requiring external high-voltage re-triggering. 

* **Thermodynamic Exhaust:** Excess radiant energy is dissipated through the stainless steel walls, calibrated to prevent the lattice temperature from exceeding the outgassing thresholds established in Phase I. 

* **Passive Fail-Safe:** The system is designed such that any interruption in the feedback loop results in a “Soft Quench,” where the $10^{-7}$ Torr vacuum instantly expands to absorb the plasma energy, preventing structural damage to the CF-flange seals.
