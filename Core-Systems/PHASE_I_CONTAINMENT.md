 #**Phase I: UHV Containment & Mu-Metal Isolation Protocol** 

 

### **1. Structural Engineering & Metallurgy** 

* **Vessel Geometry:** Dual-hemispherical 316L Stainless Steel vacuum chamber utilizing **ConFlat (CF)** knife-edge flanges for metal-to-metal vacuum sealing. 

* **Magnetic Permeability:** Interior surfaces are treated to maintain $\mu_r < 1.02$, preventing parasitic magnetic flux during the Z-Pinch discharge. 

* **Radiological Shielding:** External cladding consists of **80% Nickel Mu-Metal alloy**, attenuated to provide a 40dB reduction in ambient electromagnetic interference (EMI). 

 

 

 

### **2. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) Kinetic Parameters** 

* **Baseline Pressure:** Target operation at $10^{-7}$ Torr ($1.33 \times 10^{-7}$ mbar) to ensure the Mean Free Path (MFP) of ions exceeds the chamber radius. 

* **Pumping Architecture:** * **Primary Stage:** Scroll-pump roughing to $10^{-3}$ Torr. 

    * **Secondary Stage:** Magnetic-bearing Turbomolecular pump rated at 300 L/s. 

* **Outgassing Mitigation:** 24-hour “Bake-out” cycle at $180^\circ\text{C}$ to liberate adsorbed water vapor and hydrocarbons from the lattice structure. 

 

### **3. Isolation & Environmental Decoupling** 

* **Vibration Damping:** The vessel is mounted on a high-mass granite optical table to decouple the vacuum environment from seismic and mechanical resonance. 

* **Thermal Control:** Integrated cooling jackets maintain the 316L wall temperature below the thermal ionization threshold of the Argon medium. 

* **Operational Intent:** This $10^{-7}$ Torr baseline is the prerequisite for the **Phase IV Argon Ionization**, ensuring the conductive pinch column is not compromised by atmospheric Nitrogen or Oxygen contaminants.
