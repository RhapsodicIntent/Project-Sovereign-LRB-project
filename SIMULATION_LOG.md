## **I. Kinetic and Magnetic Pressure Equilibrium**

The stability of the **Argon Z-Pinch** is governed by the radial momentum equation in a cylindrical coordinate system. For a steady-state plasma column, the inward Lorentz force $(\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B})$ must be perfectly balanced by the outward thermal pressure gradient $(\nabla p)$.

### **1. The Bennett Relation Derivation**
For a plasma with a uniform current density and temperature, the integrated pressure balance yields the **Bennett Relation**:
$$\mu_0 I^2 = 8 \pi N k_B (T_e + T_i)$$
* **$I$ (Discharge Current):** $1,862 \text{ A}$.
* **$N$ (Linear Density):** $3.3 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}^{-1}$.
* **$k_B$ (Boltzmann Constant):** $1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}$.
* **$T_i$ (Ion Temperature):** $1.2 \times 10^6 \text{ K}$.
* **$T_e$ (Electron Temperature):** Assumed near-thermal equilibrium in Phase V.



### **2. Magnetic Flux Density Gradient**
According to Ampère’s Law, the magnetic field $B_{\theta}$ at a radius $r$ outside the conductor is:
$$B_{\theta}(r) = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}$$
At the plasma boundary ($r = 2 \text{ mm}$), the flux density $B$ is approximately **0.186 Tesla**. The magnetic pressure $P_m$ is then:
$$P_m = \frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0} = 2,175 \text{ Pa}$$

## **II. Electromagnetic Induction and Bifilar Nulling**

The induction system is designed to achieve high-current transients while suppressing parasitic inductance that would otherwise impede the $1,862 \text{ A}$ target.

### **1. Inductance Cancellation**
The **144-turn bifilar winding** utilizes counter-propagating current paths. The total inductance $L_{tot}$ of a bifilar pair is defined by:
$$L_{tot} = L_1 + L_2 - 2M$$
Where $M$ is the mutual inductance. In a perfectly coupled bifilar geometry, $M \approx L$, resulting in $L_{tot} \approx 0$. This allows for a near-instantaneous $dI/dt$ during the pinch phase.

### **2. Mu-Metal Shielding and Flux Attenuation**
To protect the $10^{-7} \text{ Torr}$ vacuum environment from external magnetic noise, a high-permeability ($\mu_r \approx 10^5$) **Mu-Metal** shield is employed. The shielding factor $S$ for a cylindrical shell is:
$$S = \frac{B_{ext}}{B_{int}} \approx \frac{\mu_r d}{D}$$
* **$d$:** Shell thickness.
* **$D$:** Shell diameter.
* **Result:** 80% Nickel Mu-Metal composition ensures internal stabilization against Reno’s local geomagnetic and industrial EMI.

## **III. Thermodynamic State and Vacuum Integrity**

The interaction between the Argon medium and the 316L vessel walls is governed by the **Ideal Gas Law** and **Mean Free Path** calculations.

### **1. Mean Free Path ($\lambda$)**
At the baseline vacuum of $10^{-7} \text{ Torr}$, the mean free path of Argon atoms is:
$$\lambda = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 p}$$
Where $d$ is the atomic diameter. This ensures that the ions accelerated by the Z-Pinch reach the central axis without collision-induced scattering.

### **2. Enthalpy and Work Potential**
The energy stored within the confined plasma volume $V$ is expressed as:
$$U = \frac{3}{2} p V + \frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0} V$$
This combined thermal and magnetic energy density forms the basis for the **277,087 vested units**. The valuation is a direct function of the total **Joules** accessible within the Phase V Singularity Loop.
